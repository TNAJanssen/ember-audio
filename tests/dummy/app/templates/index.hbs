  <h1>Ember Audio</h1>
  <h3>Making the WebAudio API super EZ since 2016</h3>

  <hr />

  <p>
    The WebAudio API is great. It's been designed to allow for extreme flexibility
    and control, as well as speed and efficiency. Unfortunately, this means that
    it's a little bit cumbersome to use.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ember Audio allows you to easily load up and play local or remote audio files
    and sound fonts as easy as this:
  </p>
</div>

<div class="content">

  <button class="btn btn-primary" {{action 'playSound'}}>Play Sound</button>

{{#code-block language='javascript'}}
  export default Ember.Whatever.extend({
    audio: Ember.inject.service(),

    initAudioFile: Ember.on('init', function() {
      // Eb5.mp3 is an mp3 file located in the "public" folder
      this.get('audio').load('piano-note', 'Eb5.mp3');
    }),

    actions: {
      playSound() {
        this.get('audio').play('piano-note');
      }
    }
  });
{{/code-block}}

</div>

    Support for the following are planned but not complete:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Custom/pluggable audio routing and effects</li>
    <li>Synthesis</li>
    <li>Timing/scheduling helpers of some kind</li>
    <li>Visualizations and "play time" helpers of some kind</li>
    <li>Volume/gain control</li>
  </ul>
