  <h2>Timing with Ember Audio</h2>

  <p>
    There are two ways to schedule sounds with Ember Audio:
  </p>
</div>

<div class="content">
  <h3>1: Manually passing a time to a <code>Sound</code> or a <code>Track</code></h3>
</div>

{{#code-block language='javascript'}}
  this.get('audio').load('some.mp3').asSound('some-sound');

  // some time later...

  const audio = this.get('audio');
  const now = audio.get('context.currentTime');
  const sound = audio.getSound('some-sound');

  sound.play(now + 1); // plays in 1 second
{{/code-block}}

<div class="content">
  <h3>2: By using a <code>Beat</code></h3>
</div>


{{#code-block language='javascript'}}
  this.get('audio').load('some.mp3').asBeat('some-sound');

  // some time later...

  const Beat = this.get('audio').getBeat('some-sound');
  const BPM = 120;

  // A "Beat" has "beats" that need to be "active" before they will play
  // This is to facilitate the way that most "drum machines" work
  Beat.get('beats').map((beat) => beat.set('isActive', true));

  // playBeats() accepts BPM and will play all active beats at that BPM,
  // leaving rests (periods with no audio) during any beat that isn't active
  // In this instance, all 8 beats would play sequentially at 120 beats per minute
  Beat.playBeats(BPM);
{{/code-block}}

<div class="content">
  <p>
    Instead of using <code>playBeats</code>, you can also call a beat's
    <code>play</code> method directly, passing an amount of time
    from now (in seconds) that the beat should play.
  </p>

  <p>
    Note that I said "time from now" and you don't have to worry about
    <code>currentTime</code>.
  </p>
</div>

{{#code-block language='javascript'}}
  // http://bradthemad.org/guitar/tempo_explanation.php
  const eighthNoteDuration = (240 * 1/8) / BPM;

  Beat.get('beats').map((beat, beatIndex) => {
    beat.play(beatIndex * eighthNoteDuration);
  });
