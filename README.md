#### Need your help!
I'm still feeling out how the API for this would be best designed, so please give me feedback/suggestions if you have any.

#### Installation
`ember install ember-audio`

#### [Interactive Demo/Documentation](http://sethbrasile.github.io/ember-audio)

Ember Audio has no external dependencies and provides an `audio` service and
various classes/mixins that make working with the Web Audio API super EZ.

Ember Audio aims to simplify sampling, triggering, routing, scheduling,
synthesizing, soundfonts, and working with audio in-general.

**Note**: Ember Audio will probably not fully respect semver until it is out of
alpha!

**Note**: Your target browsers must be modern!: http://caniuse.com/#feat=audio-api
