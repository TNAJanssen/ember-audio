# Ember-audio

A light-weight wrapper for the
[howler.js](https://github.com/goldfire/howler.js/) WebAudio library, packaged
as an ember addon.

It aims to provide an `audio` service that makes working with howler.js in ember
projects super EZ.

This is experimental!! The API is not fully fleshed out so it has not been
published! Please feel free to contribute if this is something that interests
you.
